            description: `
                MOTS was originally created for the Premi Ludi 2024, where it received the “Best Fun” award granted by SocialPoint, as well as the GameBCN prize. This recognition opened the door to further development in collaboration with an external studio for an official release on 3cat.<br><br>

                From the very beginning, every design decision in MOTS revolved around a single goal: helping players learn Catalan in a natural, playful way. All mechanics, progression systems, and interface elements were conceived to make the language approachable and engaging for a broad audience ranging from 12 to 60 years old.<br><br>

                As a mobile-first project, accessibility and simplicity were at the core of the experience. The challenge was to design mechanics that were both entertaining and educational, ensuring that players could learn new words while enjoying a casual yet meaningful experience. The game’s central system allows users to form words by arranging letters into specific shapes under certain constraints, balancing logic, skill, and discovery.<br><br>

                To reinforce the learning aspect, we integrated a dictionary feature where players collect and review every Catalan word they uncover as they progress through the levels. This mechanic not only rewards curiosity but also provides a tangible sense of linguistic growth throughout the game.<br><br>

                Through numerous iterations, we refined the balance between difficulty, pacing, and player motivation, crafting a progressive learning curve that invites both younger and older audiences to improve their Catalan vocabulary at their own rhythm. Additionally, great care was taken to ensure accessibility for all players, including features for color-blind and blind users through touch-based screen scanning systems typical of modern mobile devices.<br><br>

                Now, as development continues in collaboration with an external company, the goal remains clear: to preserve the spirit of the original concept—a fun, inclusive, and educational experience that celebrates and promotes the Catalan language.

                Ares Atlas was developed in just eight days, it became one of our most ambitious and mechanically innovative creations. The collaboration between a talented technical team and an artist who perfectly captured the project’s vision allowed us to deliver a polished and engaging experience that went far beyond our expectations.<br><br>

                The game was awarded Best Technology and received honorable mentions for Best Game and Best Design at the jam. The theme, “Evolution: Trial and Error”, presented a major design challenge, pushing us to explore how gameplay could evolve dynamically through player experimentation and adaptation.<br><br>

                As the Game Designer and Level Designer, I was responsible for defining and balancing all core mechanics, as well as designing every level to ensure a smooth progression and a consistent sense of discovery. My goal was to create mechanics that felt intuitive yet deep, rewarding creative thinking and adaptability.<br><br>

                One of the project’s most remarkable achievements was the implementation of a single-button system that allowed players to switch between 2D and 3D perspectives in real time. This feature became the heart of the gameplay, shaping every level’s structure and requiring careful coordination between design, programming, and visual composition.<br><br>

                Throughout development, I created multiple prototype levels to test pacing, difficulty, and flow. These iterations led to the design of a complete tutorial that made the experience accessible for players of all skill levels, as well as distinct biomes that progressively introduced new mechanics and environmental challenges.<br><br>

                Looking back, Ares Atlas stands out not only as a technical and creative milestone, but also as a testament to how thoughtful design and teamwork can turn a bold concept into a cohesive, award-winning experience.

                During the development of this project, I focused primarily on level design, taking full responsibility for the creation of levels 1, 2, and 3. My work began with extensive layout planning, where I designed the structure and flow of each map to ensure a coherent progression and a strong gameplay rhythm.<br><br>

                Each layout was carefully iterated to establish a clear sense of direction, pacing, and challenge. I developed detailed flowcharts to define player paths, enemy placements, and key interactions, ensuring that every encounter felt meaningful and supported the intended difficulty curve.<br><br>

                A major part of my work involved balancing the overall progression — determining how difficulty, enemies, and environmental elements evolved across the three levels. This required multiple playtesting sessions and QA-driven refinements to fine-tune pacing, combat flow, and player engagement.<br><br>

                In addition to level design, I also contributed to the implementation of audio and visual elements that enhanced the game’s atmosphere and feedback. Through custom effects and sound cues, I aimed to align the sensory experience with gameplay rhythm, improving clarity and immersion.<br><br>

                Throughout development, I played a central role in QA and testing, paying close attention to environment consistency, pacing, and player responsiveness. This process was essential to ensure that the final experience felt cohesive, polished, and satisfying from start to finish.

                Mind’s Abyss is a cooperative puzzle-platformer where two players embody Nightmare and Dream as they navigate the depths of the subconscious. Developed for the 7th CITM Game Jam, this project was an intense creative challenge completed within just seven days.<br><br>

                As Game Designer and Level Designer, I was responsible for developing all cooperative mechanics, defining how each player’s unique role would influence the gameplay experience and how both could complement one another through teamwork. The mechanics were designed to foster communication, coordination, and problem-solving, making collaboration the central pillar of the experience.<br><br>

                Once the core systems were established, I focused on designing levels that intertwined both players’ abilities, ensuring that each environment naturally encouraged cooperation. Every challenge, platforming section, and puzzle was built around the interaction between Dream and Nightmare, reinforcing their distinct roles while maintaining a balanced progression for both players.<br><br>

                A significant portion of my work also involved creating the tutorial level, which served as both a mechanical and narrative introduction. It guided players through the basic interactions and dynamics of teamwork, setting the tone for the rest of the game.<br><br>

                Beyond level and systems design, I contributed to the visual effects (VFX) to enhance the overall atmosphere and provide responsive feedback aligned with player actions. Subtle effects helped underline key interactions and heightened the emotional impact of the gameplay.<br><br>

                Through continuous iteration and testing, we refined mobility, puzzle pacing, and the cooperative flow between roles to deliver a smooth and immersive experience that captured the essence of teamwork within a mysterious and emotional world.

            description: `
                Stelar was developed for the Indie TRS Game Jam under the theme “Order in Chaos.” From the very beginning, I wanted to explore how a sense of structure could emerge within something inherently disordered. This idea led me to reflect on the contrast between constellations — a system of order we impose — and outer space, a vast and chaotic environment by nature.<br><br>

                With this concept in mind, and considering our target audience, I decided to create a puzzle game where players could bring order to chaos by connecting stars and forming constellations. Each puzzle represented the process of discovery and organization within the unknown, while the level selector served as an exploration map where players gradually unveiled new constellations.<br><br>

                As the Game Designer, I was responsible for defining the game’s core mechanics, ensuring that they were both intuitive and engaging within the jam’s limited timeframe. I designed the puzzle structure and progression, creating early prototypes that allowed us to test pacing, difficulty, and player understanding.<br><br>

                Throughout development, we iterated constantly to refine the core mechanic, achieving a gameplay loop that felt simple yet rewarding. To increase depth and variety, I implemented four unique block types that introduced new challenges and strategic possibilities, progressively enriching the experience.<br><br>

                Finally, I designed a tutorial level focused on clarity and accessibility, allowing players of all ages to learn the mechanics intuitively while maintaining a sense of discovery and wonder — an essential aspect of the game’s core theme.

            description: `
                Sure? was developed for the Truth and Lies: Capital of Democracy Game Jam in Barcelona, where it was awarded Best Game of the event.<br><br>
                This project represented one of the most complex design challenges I’ve faced to date, as it required creating a cooperative experience that functioned simultaneously across two different devices while encouraging in-person communication between players.<br><br>
                The central idea revolved around the concept of detecting fake news. Each player took on a distinct role within a newsroom: one received the questions and context, while the other had access to answers, sources, and visual material. The key to success was collaboration under pressure — players had to share information, compare data, and reach conclusions before the timer ran out.<br><br>
                From a design perspective, one of the main challenges was ensuring that both roles felt equally engaging and interdependent, despite their asymmetry. I focused on defining complementary gameplay loops that required continuous dialogue and mutual trust, turning communication itself into the core mechanic.<br><br>
                Because the content displayed on each screen was entirely different, I also worked on designing distinct information flows, making sure that clues, visuals, and cues aligned perfectly to drive cooperation rather than confusion.<br><br>
                The result was a dynamic, fast-paced experience that challenged players not only to think critically but to truly work as a team in real time — embodying the jam’s theme through mechanics that blurred the line between truth and deception.
